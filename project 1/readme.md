 This code takes the PAN number of a person as input and checks whether the records exists in its file.
   <ul>
   <li>if found then the details of the person are displayed
   <li>if the details are not found, then it takes the various details of the user as input and calculates the tax that the user has to pay at the end of the year.
   Finally, it stores the details of the person and the other values in a csv file from where the details can be fetched when the query is raised again.
